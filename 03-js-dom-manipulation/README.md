# JavaScript Homework: Student Picker Application

## OBJECTIVE:

The goal of this homework is to create a web application where the user can:

1. Add students to a list with a unique avatar, randomly assigned color, and their name.
2. Display all added students in a list format.
3. Randomly select a student and display their details in a card, with the avatar having the same border color as the student's assigned color.

## REQUIREMENTS:

1. Student Entry:

   - The user should be able to input a student’s name in a text box.
   - A random color should be automatically assigned to each student.
   - Upon clicking the Add Student button, the student should be added to the list.
   - Each student should have an avatar generated using the DiceBear API.

2. Displaying Students:

   - The student list should display:
   - The name of the student.
   - A small circle next to the student's name representing the random color assigned to the student.
   - The DiceBear avatar for each student.
   - A Delete button for removing a student from the list.

3. Randomly Picking a Student:

   - The user should be able to click a Pick a Student button, which will randomly select a student from the list.
   - Once a student is selected, their name and avatar (with a border matching their assigned color) should be displayed in a card.

## OPTIONAL:

    - You have attached an image of a possible UI implementation.
    - You may use the attached design.html and style.css files for the UI implementation.
    - You may use Bootstrap for styling the interface to ensure it's clean and responsive.
    - The app should be fully interactive and shouldn’t require a page reload to add or remove students.
    - Ensure that users cannot add a student with an empty name field.
